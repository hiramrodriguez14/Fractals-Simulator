# PA3: Fractals
This repository is part of a Programming Assignment for the Advanced Programming Course. 
The purpose of this project is to creatively help the student create practical programming skills by implementing changes to the base code that require strong understanding of the concepts discussed in class.

## Setup
1. Clone this project inside your OpenFrameworks enviorement folder "apps/myApps/" directory
2. Run the command "make" in the terminal or the "Build" Task in VSCode.
3. To run the project using the included debug configurations you must make sure to change the debugging program attribute for the corresponding configuration according to your OS. The executable will have the same name as this repository, and if on Windows, it 
will end in ".exe"

## Submitting Assignment
To submit this assignment, create a Release with the branch that holds all the changes you have added. If no Release is made, the last commit to the master branch will be graded.

Don't forget that you must also fill out an evaluation form in Moodle to consider the project submitted.

## Grading

Partner 1: 802-21-3557 Yandiel Hernandez Otero yandiel.hernandez@upr.edu
Partner 2: (802-21-0787) (Hiram R. Rodriguez Hernandez) (hiram.rodriguez14@upr.edu)

Any project that doesn't compile will receive a 0.

If a partner has no commits in the repositories, they'll will receive a 0.

## Student Notes
If you have any notes to add for your TA about the project specs or creative additions, you may do so in this section of the README: Added a complex fractal (a fractal with real and imaginary numbers) called mandelbrot, the draw was made iterative but the calculation of the complex coordinates was made recursively. Because it iterates over every pixel on the computer it is a little slow but i wish your computer can handle it ;p. Finally we added some chill music!
